System Structure/Files:

#use "ctrl + alt + t" to open terminal window from anywhere
#you can open any application by typing it's name 

    cd /  – Takes you to the root directory.
    cd .. – Takes you up one directory level.
    cd –  – Takes you to the previous directory.

    cd: The cd command will allow you to change directories. When you open a terminal you will be in your home directory. To move around the file system you will use cd. Examples:

    To navigate into the root directory, use "cd /"

    To navigate to your home directory, use "cd" or "cd ~"

    To navigate up one directory level, use "cd .."

    To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use "cd -"

    To navigate through multiple levels of directory at once, specify the full directory path that you want to go to. For example, use, "cd /var/www" to go directly to the /www subdirectory of /var/. As another example, "cd ~/Desktop" will move you to the Desktop subdirectory inside your home directory. 

"ranger"	shows all system files in hierachial structure
"ls" 		(list) command lists all files and folders in your current working directory. You can also specify paths to other directories if you want to view their contents.
"pwd"		(print working directory) Ubuntu command displays the full pathname of the current working directory.
"dpkg --list"	lists all the packages in machine
"ncdu"		tells you which files are taking up the most space on computer
"du" 		(directory usage) command displays the size of a directory and all of its subdirectories.
"mkdir"		(make directory) command allows you to create a new directory. You can specify where you want the directory created – if you do not do so, it will be created in your current working directory.
"mv"		(move) command allows you to move files. You can also rename files by moving them to the directory they are currently in, but under a new name. The usage is the same as cp – for example mv xyz /home/myfiles would move the file “xyz” to the directory “/home/myfiles”.
"cp"		(copy) Linux command allows you to copy a file. You should specify both the file you want to be copied and the location you want it copied to – for example, cp xyz /home/myfiles would copy the file “xyz” to the directory “/home/myfiles”.


Terminal Aids:
"clear"		clears terminal
"exit"		exit terminal
"history"	command displays all of your previous commands up to the history limit.


Special Commands:
"passwd" lets you change the user's password from terminal: passwd <user>
